## Introduction

This report captures the steps, tools and codes used to analyze dataset from Cyclistic to reveal some insights into the data that can be used by stakeholders to meet their objectives.
The main objective of this project is to **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**.

The detail case study can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/7PGIT/case-study-1-how-does-a-bike-share-navigate-speedy-success) at the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** course or at this [Link.](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/aacF81H_TsWnBfNR_x7FIg_36299b28fa0c4a5aba836111daad12f1_DAC8-Case-Study-1.pdf?Expires=1644364800&Signature=R56OjAyx9ZGBJPJEBLihJv0~vicHKxREKbY8K5iqEt1-Pf36-7oCE24uREWPN6SuLSp6rtKH66zK7BNZYUPj02wTf-RMP8byTma0yubDh~8-mtozlvCU5kQVDLZfQTHBb-5jn3qJCf5TF0iofrqTWar5iI39U10qWEzerJ7ehLg_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)

As a Data Analyst, I followed the data analysis steps below to complete this project:

**ASK**

**PREPARE**

**PROCESS**

**ANALYZE**

**SHARE**

**ACT**




## **ASK**
In the ASK phase, the following questions are considered to help guide the data analysts in this project.
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

However, this study aims at finding the solution to the first question **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

I began with considering the following question:
-  What is the problem you are trying to solve?

The main objective for the marketing department is to **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**.

-  How can your insights drive business decisions?

The insight to this dataset will be used to design marketing strategies to increse the number of annual members.




## **PREPARE**

The dataset used for this study can be found at this [Link.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) 

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [License.](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

The tools I used in this phase are: Excel and SQL.

The original dataset is compiled on a monthly basis. I downloaded dataset from the above link, renamed them, and uploaded them into SQL for further manipulation.



## **PROCESS**

This phase covers the steps taken to process the data to get it ready for the analysis and visualization.

The original data was in csv file format. And there were initially 21 files with monthly Cyclistic trip data starting from 2020-04 to 2021-12.

Each of the files were uploaded to postgreSQL for cleaning.

The data cleaning codes used are found in the [bike_share](bike_share.ipynb) notebook.

The steps in the above jupyter notebook are summarized as follows:

- First, all the data was uploaded directly to PostgreSQL.
- Set up the conda environment and opened the jupyter notebook
- Combined all the 21 different data into a single file and eliminated all duplicated rows using the **UNION** command
- Eliminated all rows with null values
- Eliminated all rows whose start date and time are after their end date and time
- Extracted the last 12 months of data for the study



## **ANALYZE**

This phase covers the steps used to analyze the cleaned data. In this phase I used Tableau. As the data was already cleaned, it did not need any further cleaning.

However, various calculated fields were created to help with the analysis. These include:
- Ride Duration (hours) code: DATEDIFF('hour',[Started At],[Ended At],'sunday')
- Ride Duration (minutes) code: DATEDIFF('minute',[Started At],[Ended At],'sunday')
- Day of week code: DATENAME('weekday',[Started At])

#### Below is a screenshot of the Tableau dashboard created for this project.

### **The following insights were drawn from the data

#### The general overview of the data indicates that there were 10.72% more number of rides taken by annual members than the casual riders.

#### However, further analysis indicates that casual riders accounted for more total and average ride duration than the annual members.

### Summary

The following are summary of the insight gotten from the Cyclistic data spanning from January 2021 and December 2021.

**- Members take about 11% more rides than Casual users. However, Casual users take longer trip duration, about twice that of Members.**

**- Generally, the number of rides correlates with the season of the year. Warmer temperatures correlate with increase in the number of rides and longer trip durations.**

**- The number of rides by Members slightly increased by ~ 33% going into the weekdays. However, ride duration are almost the same throughout the week.**

**- Contrary, Casual users take 2X more number of rides and trip durations during the weekends than the weekdays.**

**- Classic bikes are the most popular bikes among both Members and Casual users, whereas, the docked bikes are only patronized by Casual users.**


### Recommendations
 The following recommendation are given based on the insight detailed in the analyzed phase.
 
**- Seasonal members packages can be introduced as marketing strategy such as: Weekend membership, Summer membership, Annual membership**

**- Ads prepared should target recreational events at weekends and during the months of May to October. Ads should also target the top stations where Casual users begin their trips.**

**- Special promotion or discount should be introduced to encourage bike users in months or season with colder temperatures to encourage patronage.**



## **SHARE**

In the phase, a presentation was prepared for all the stakeholders.

Presentation to the stakeholders can be found [here.](https://github.com/badugyamfi/badugyamfi-capstone_project_1/blob/b4030d49d407b0c68af0f1b4ae14bb5fcbc926e5/Cyclistic%20Bike-Share.pptx)

## **ACT**

In this phase, the marketing team would consider, improve where needed and implement the recommendations given in this project.
